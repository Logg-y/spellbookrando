Hopefully the options are relatively straightforward and self-explanatory, though some are redundant (it will still ask if you want to keep communions together if you're leaving them alone). Source is provided. Updates to the spells.csv file should be obtained from the dom5inspector github repo (which is also under the included GPL v3) and is available at https://github.com/larzm42/dom5inspector

(specifically, check the gamedata folder)

The spells.csv included in this version is for 5.48.
